## Deploying onto AWS

If you're looking for a simple way to deploy this to the Amazon Web Services Cloud, check out the [Minecraft Server Deployment (CloudFormation) repository](https://github.com/vatertime/minecraft-spot-pricing). This repository contains a CloudFormation template that will get you up and running in AWS in a matter of minutes. Optionally it uses Spot Pricing so the server is very cheap, and you can easily turn it off when not in use.
